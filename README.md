# 📚 GyaanDaan – Empowering Education for Every Child 🇮🇳

Millions of underprivileged students in India lack access to quality education. GyaanDaan bridges this gap by connecting **passionate volunteers** with **communities that need them the most** — providing teaching, mentorship, and life-changing resources.
